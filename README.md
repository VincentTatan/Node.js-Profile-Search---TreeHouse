# Node.js-Profile-Search---TreeHouse

##This is an app experiment of node.js that I build from TreeHouse tutorial. Will increase improvements from here as I learnt node js along the way.

Please feel free to fork from here and contribute to my node js project.

Improvements will include:
- To add on choices and menus from different badges and profile
- To allow recommendations and suggestions of names(vincent will have choices : vincenttatan, vincent, vincent13)
- To allow search engine that gives multiple profiles that have the same name (similar to facebook applications)
-  etc (please add on to how you contribute)

* Lastly feel free to approach me via my email vincentt.2013@sis.smu.edu.sg, I am always here to learn and answer your queries! *
